// this script will cover form validation, and will also disable default form
// validation to ensure cross broswer experience is the same
/*Requirements:
- _join.html_
  - add form validation that works in all major browsers (you'll need to
  deactivate browser validate to check this)
  - form validation should have all fields marked "required" required, and all
  email fields should require and check for proper email syntax.
  - any validation errors should be presented clearly to the user so that they
  may correct them
  - on completion of the form, navigate the user to the gallery, passing their
  name to the page
