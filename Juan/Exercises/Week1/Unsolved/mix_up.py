# Given a string s, return a string
# where all occurences of its first char have
# been changed to '*', except do not change
# the first char itself.
# e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
# Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
# Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s
# where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.

s = input("Give me a string! ")
stra = s[0]
strb = "*"
print(stra)
n = s[1:]
print(n)
n.replace(stra, strb)
print(n)
s = stra + n
print(s)


# Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
# by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
# e.g.
#   'mix', pod' -> 'pox mid'
#   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'
# Assume a and b are length 2 or more.
