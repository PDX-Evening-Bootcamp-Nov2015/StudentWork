# Write a program where you think of a number and computer guesses it.  The
# computer should prompt you for a number range, make a guess and then ask you to
# enter either H or C  or P(hotter/colder/picked it) and continues guessing until
# it has picked your number.  It should return the count of how many moves it took
# and how wide the range was.
