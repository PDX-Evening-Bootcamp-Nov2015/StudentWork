# You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
# Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the products.
#
# For example, given:
#   [1, 7, 3, 4]
#
# your function would return:
#   [84, 12, 28, 21]
#
# by calculating:
#   [7*3*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*7*3]
