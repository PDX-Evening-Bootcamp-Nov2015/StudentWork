# Given a string which may include opening or closing round brackets, write a function to determine
# whether the string contains a balanced pair(s) of round brackets, that is there are no brackets
# which are either opened & not closed, or vice versa. Opening round brackets always have to come
# before closing bracket. An empty string is balanced.
#
# isBalanced("hi)(") == False
# isBalanced("hi(hi)") == True
# isBalanced("(") == False
