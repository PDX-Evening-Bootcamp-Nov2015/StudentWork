Look at students.dat -> write a class (Student) with the following methods:
    - get_average
    - get_score
    - get_last_score
    - get_passing_grade

for get score they should be able to enter a number that returns the score for
the nth test.

for get_passing_grade assume they have a final which counts for 1/2 their grade
and return the minimum score they need to get to pass.

Try to write the tests and then write the code to pass them.
